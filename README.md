## Learning Goals

- Use a class variable to keep track of every instance of a class that is
  created
- Write a class method to access the list of all instances of a class, stored in
  a class variable

## Introduction

The government has decided to start tracking every new puppy that is born, just
like we track every new child who is born with a birth certificate. Because
you're such a notoriously skilled programmer, you've been hired by the newly
minted United States Department of Canines to write a program that will do just
that.

You need to write a program that stores each new puppy that is born. You will
write a `Dog` class that initializes with a name and also stores each new
instance of `Dog` that is instantiated.

## Instructions

Code your solution in `lib/dog.rb`, using the test error messages from running
`learn` as a guide to your solution.

- Create a class variable `@@all` set to an empty array inside your class. This
  array is the storage container for each instance of a `Dog` that gets
  created. In other words, every puppy that is born should get pushed into this
  array at the moment of instantiation––in the `#initialize` method! Use the
  `self` keyword inside the `#initialize` method to refer to the new dog you are
  trying to store in your `@@all` array.

- Write a class method, `.all`, that reads this variable. From inside the `Dog`
  class, we can access the `@@all` class variable, but whenever we might be
  interacting with our `Dog` class from the outside, this `.all` class method acts
  as our direct interface to the `@@all` variable.

- You will need to write a class method, `.print_all`, that iterates over all of
  the individual dogs stored in the `@@all` array and `puts` out their name to the
  terminal.

- Now that we've gotten these methods written out, it is time do a bit of
  refactoring. Rather than pushing `self` into the `@@all` variable inside of
  `#initialize`, we're extracting this action into its own method. Call this method
  `#save`. The method should handle the task of pushing `self` into `@@all`.
  Once written, update your code in `#initialize` so that it uses `#save`.

There is one method that we'll talk about together:

### The `.clear_all` Method

What happens if we want to clear out our list of existing dogs? It is not at all
uncommon to want to "reset" or "restart" our program. You'll be building a class
method, `.clear_all`, that does just that. This method should operate on the
`@@all` array of existing dogs and empty that array. **Hint:** look up the
`Array#clear` method.

### A Note on Testing

In the test suite, you'll see this code:

```ruby
expect(Dog.class_variable_get(:@@all)).to match([])
```

Here, we are using the `.class_variable_get(name_of_class_variable)` method on
the `Dog` class. This method introspects on the class on which it is called and
retrieves the value of the class variable passed into the method as an argument.
We use it here in the test suite to check that you do in fact set a class
variable, `@@all`, equal to an empty array and that you fill that array up with
new dogs as they are instantiated.
